"Quantum computing uses qubits instead of classical bits to perform calculations. These qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to a phenomenon called superposition. This allows quantum computers to solve complex problems much faster than traditional supercomputers. However, maintaining qubit stability remains a significant engineering challenge for researchers today."
