"The efficacy of mRNA vaccines relies on the delivery of a genetic sequence that instructs cells to produce a spike protein. This protein triggers an immune response, producing antibodies without using a live virus. Clinical trials demonstrated high protection rates across diverse populations. Long-term monitoring continues to assess the duration of immunity and potential variants' impact on vaccine effectiveness. Public health officials emphasize the importance of global distribution to achieve herd immunity."
